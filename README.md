# Investigating-European-Soccer-Database

This soccer database comes from Kaggle and is well suited for data analysis and machine learning. It contains data for soccer matches, players and teams from several European

countries from 2008 to 2016. In this project I explored the data and performed data cleaning using python libraries like numpy, pandas, Matplotlib and others. I posed some

research question on this data and performed EDA (Exploratory Data Analysis) to get answers and draw conclusions. Finally, I put some useful links and references which helped me

completing this project.
